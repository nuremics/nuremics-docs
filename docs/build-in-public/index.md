# Build In Public

Behind the **NUREMICS** framework lies a growing ecosystem dedicated to empowering the full spectrum of _Numerical Sciences_.

This **Build In Public** section brings that mission to life: we develop, in full transparency, a suite of open, modular **NUREMICS** components designed for diverse fields of _Numerical Sciences_.

Each topic reflects a focused deep-dive into a specific branch of the _Numerical Sciences_, shaped by curiosity, community feedback, and a commitment to share every step of the journey.

**Why Build In Public?**

- To democratize access to high-quality scientific software.
- To showcase the diversity of numerical workflows and applications.
- To foster collaboration with engineers, researchers, and developers.
- To build a community around shared tools and reusable components.

**Follow. Engage. Contribute.** Each topic has its own dedicated page and Discord channel, where you can follow progress, test components, share feedback, or contribute directly.
