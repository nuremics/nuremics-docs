# Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Data Science

Coming soon...

<!-- This topic focuses on the design and implementation of **nuRemics** components dedicated to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science workflows:

- **Data collection & Preprocessing:** Collect and preprocess raw data from various sources — applying cleaning, normalization, and transformation techniques to ensure high-quality data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze and visualize data to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses — using statistical summaries and graphical representations to gain initial insights.
- **Feature engineering:** Extract and select meaningful features from raw data — improving the input quality to enhance model performance and interpretability.
- **Model selection & Training:** Implement and train AI models using a variety of algorithms — including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, reinforcement, evolutionary, and hybrid methods.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimize model parameters via techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization — to maximize predictive performance.
- **Model evaluation & Validation:** Assess model performance through appropriate metrics and validation strategies — ensuring accuracy, robustness, and generalizability across datasets.
- **Inference & Prediction:** Deploy trained models to perform predictions, classifications, or decisions on new, unseen data — supporting data-driven insights and automated analysis.
- **Model interpretation & Explainability:** Understand and explain AI model decisions and behavior — using techniques like feature importance analysis, saliency maps, or surrogate models to build trust and transparency.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Create comprehensive visualizations and reports — communicating data insights, model outcomes, and scientific findings effectively through interactive dashboards, charts, and summaries.
